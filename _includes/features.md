**SuperCollider** features three major components:<br /><br />
*scsynth* – A real-time audio engine implemented as a server  
*sclang* – An interpreted programming language which acts as a client to the server  
*scide* – An editor for sclang with an integrated help system  
<br />
Due to the client/server architecture, it is possible for multiple clients to connect and control what is happening on the server.
Although [sclang](https://docs.supercollider.online/Tutorials/Getting-Started/01-Introductory-Remarks.html) is the native language and client for the server, there are also several client implementations in other programming languages such as [Python](https://supriya-project.github.io/supriya/), [JavaScript](https://crucialfelix.github.io/supercolliderjs/#/), [Haskell](https://rohandrape.net/?t=hsc3) or [Scala](https://codeberg.org/sciss/ScalaCollider).
<br />
SuperCollider also includes an alternative implementation of scsynth called **supernova** which has multi-threading support.
<br /><br />
**SuperCollider** was developed by James McCartney and originally released in 1996.  
In 2002, he generously released it as free software under the GNU General Public License.  
Since then, it is maintained and developed by an active and enthusiastic community.
