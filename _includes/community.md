SuperCollider is a community project and there are several communities to join.
For an incomplete list, take a look at the [communities site](Community).

A good place to start is _the forum_ located at [scsynth.org](https://scsynth.org).

We also have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
