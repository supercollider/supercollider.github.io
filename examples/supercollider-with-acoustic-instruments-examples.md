This page lists compositions for solo acoustic instrument (or voice) with electronics made with SuperCollider (real-time or fixed-media). The list was initially compiled in March of 2014 after an open call made through the SuperCollider Users mailing list (you can see the original thread [here] (http://new-supercollider-mailing-lists-forums-use-these.2681727.n2.nabble.com/Pieces-for-solo-instrument-SuperCollider-td7609151.html)). Most pieces were submitted by the composers themselves. A few were included based on references found on the web.

Feel free to edit this page to add new pieces to it (instructions at the very bottom of this page). Please include links to scores and recordings, when available.

Composers are listed alphabetically by last name.

### How to add your piece to this list

Feel free to edit the page yourself. See the instructions for simple edits [here] (https://supercollider.github.io/contributing/supercollider-github-com.html).

Once you get to the step where you see the contents of the file in an editable window, simply add the new pieces following these conventions:

* If adding a new composer, insert it in alphabetical order by last name.

* Leave a blank line between your lines of text.

* Include `####` just before the name of the composer: this will format it correctly when the page is rendered. For example, `####Giuseppe Verdi`

* Enclose the name of the piece with `**` (before and after): this will make it bold face. For example, `**La Traviata** (1853), singers and SuperCollider`

* Include the direct link to score and/or recording in the next line. Copy the link twice: first between brackets [], then between parentheses ().

* If in doubt, just look at existing entries and you will see how to do it.

Clicking "Preview" at the top of the editing window will let you see how your proposed changes will look like. If anything doesn't look right, click on "Code" again and fix the errors. When you are ready, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the green button.

*If you are having trouble with editing the page, you can alternatively send the info to bruviaro at scu dot edu and I'll add it to the page when I have time.*
