This page lists compositions for solo acoustic instrument (or voice) with electronics made with SuperCollider (real-time or fixed-media). The list was initially compiled in March of 2014 after an open call made through the SuperCollider Users mailing list (you can see the original thread [here] (http://new-supercollider-mailing-lists-forums-use-these.2681727.n2.nabble.com/Pieces-for-solo-instrument-SuperCollider-td7609151.html)). Most pieces were submitted by the composers themselves. A few were included based on references found on the web.

Feel free to edit this page to add new pieces to it (you will need a github account). Please include links to scores and recordings, when available.

Composers are listed alphabetically by last name.
