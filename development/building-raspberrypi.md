Compiling SCIDE natively on Raspberry Pi Raspbian
==
note: this is for building the full version of supercollider 3.9 including the ide under **raspbian stretch with desktop**. it is the easiest way to compile sc and this version can also run headless. see below for building non-qt, non scide under **raspbian stretch lite**.

requirements
--
* raspberry pi 2 or 3
* sd card with [2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian) or newer (note: not stretch lite)
* router with ethernet internet connection for the rpi
* screen, mouse and keyboard (although you can also do it all via ssh)
* optional: usb soundcard with headphones or speakers connected

step1 (hardware setup)
--
1. connect an ethernet cable from the network router to the rpi
2. insert the sd card and usb soundcard. connect screen, mouse and keyboard
3. last connect usb power from a 5V@1A power supply

step2 (update the system, install required libraries)
--
from raspbian desktop open a terminal window and type...
1. `sudo raspi-config`  #change password and optionally edit hostname and enable ssh and/or vnc
2. `sudo apt-get update`
3. `sudo apt-get upgrade`
4. `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
5. `sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev libicu-dev libreadline-dev libfftw3-dev libxt-dev libudev-dev libcwiid-dev cmake qt5-default qt5-qmake qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev libqt5webkit5-dev qtpositioning5-dev libqt5sensors5-dev`

step3 (compile and install supercollider)
--
1. `git clone --recursive git://github.com/supercollider/supercollider`
2. `cd supercollider`
3. `git checkout 3.9`
4. `git submodule init && git submodule update`
5. `mkdir build && cd build`
6. `cmake -L -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNATIVE=ON -DSC_WII=ON -DSC_IDE=ON -DSC_QT=ON -DSC_ED=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF -DSC_VIM=ON ..`
7. `make -j 4`  #use -j4 flag only for rpi3 (quadcore)
8. `sudo make install`
9. `sudo ldconfig`

step4 (set up jack)
--
the `-dhw:0` below is the internal soundcard. change this to `-dhw:1` for usb soundcards. `aplay -l` will list available devices.
1. `nano ~/.jackdrc`  #edit to look like this...
        
        /usr/bin/jackd -P75 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n3
        
2. press ctrl+o to save and ctrl+x to exit

another way to set up and start jack is to open a terminal and type `qjackctl`. click 'setup' to select soundcard and set periods to 3 (recommended). then start jack before scide by clicking the play icon.

startup
--
from raspbian desktop just open a terminal and type...
* `scide`

(see notes below about alsamixer volume)

headless
--
if you want to ssh in and start this sc version headless, run the following commands...
* `export DISPLAY=:0.0`
* `sclang`

**done!** see below for sc3-plugins, autostart, benchmarks and notes

Compiling SC natively on Raspberry Pi Raspbian Lite
==
note: this section is for more advanced users that want to compile and run supercollider (sclang+scsynth) under **raspbian stretch lite**. it does not include qt nor the ide.

requirements
--
* raspberry pi 2 or 3 (see notes for rpi 1)
* sd card with [2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian) or newer
* an empty dummy file called `ssh` on the root level of the sd card (to enable ssh)
* router with ethernet internet connection for the rpi
* laptop connected to same network as the rpi
* optional: usb soundcard with headphones or speakers connected

step1 (hardware setup)
--
1. connect an ethernet cable from the network router to the rpi
2. insert the sd card and usb soundcard
3. last connect usb power from a 5V@1A power supply

step2 (update the system, install required libraries)
--
1. `ssh pi@raspberrypi`  #from your laptop, default password is raspberry
2. `sudo raspi-config`  #change password and optionally edit hostname, set memory split to 16
3. `sudo apt-get update`
4. `sudo apt-get upgrade`
5. `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
6. `sudo apt-get install libsamplerate0-dev libjack-jackd2-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev libicu-dev libreadline-dev libfftw3-dev libxt-dev libudev-dev libcwiid-dev cmake git`

step3 (compile & install jackd (no d-bus) )
--
1. `git clone git://github.com/jackaudio/jack2 --depth 1`
2. `cd jack2`
3. `./waf configure --alsa --libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/`
4. `./waf build`
5. `sudo ./waf install`
6. `sudo ldconfig`
7. `cd ..`
8. `rm -rf jack2`
9. `sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf`  #and add the following lines at the end...
        
        @audio - memlock 256000
        @audio - rtprio 75
        
10. `exit`  #and ssh in again to make the limits.conf settings work
11. `nano ~/.jackdrc`  #edit to look like this...
        
        /usr/local/bin/jackd -P75 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n3
        
the `-dhw:0` above is the internal soundcard. change this to `-dhw:1` for usb soundcards. `aplay -l` will list available devices.

step4 (compile & install sc master)
--
1. `git clone --recursive git://github.com/supercollider/supercollider`
2. `cd supercollider`
3. `git checkout 3.9`
4. `git submodule init && git submodule update`
5. `nano lang/LangSource/SC_TerminalClient.cpp`  #TEMP FIX for 100% sclang issue - find the first line and comment it out, add the 2nd right after
        
        //mTimer.cancel();
        if (error==boost::system::errc::success) {mTimer.cancel();} else {return;}
        
6. `mkdir build && cd build`
7. `cmake -L -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNATIVE=ON -DSC_WII=ON -DSC_IDE=OFF -DSC_QT=OFF -DSC_ED=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF -DSC_VIM=ON ..`

10. `sudo ldconfig`
11. `sudo mv /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/SCClassLibrary/Common/GUI /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/SCClassLibrary/scide_scqt/GUI`
12. `sudo mv /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/SCClassLibrary/JITLib/GUI /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/SCClassLibrary/scide_scqt/JITLibGUI`

startup
--
* `sclang`

**done!** see below for sc3-plugins, autostart, benchmarks and notes

sc3-plugins
==
how to compile and install [sc3-plugins](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins). this applies to both the scide and lite versions above.
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins.git --depth 1`
2. `cd sc3-plugins`
3. `mkdir build && cd build`
4. `cmake -L -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNATIVE=ON -DSC_PATH=../../supercollider/ ..`
5. `make -j 4`  #use -j4 flag only for rpi3 (quadcore)
6. `sudo make install`

autostart
==
how to automatically run supercollider code at system boot. this applies to both the scide and lite versions above.
1. `nano ~/autostart.sh`  #and add the following lines (ctrl+o, ctrl+x to save and exit)...
        
        #!/bin/bash
        PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
        export DISPLAY=:0.0
        sleep 5
        sclang mycode.scd
        
2. `chmod +x ~/autostart.sh`
3. `crontab -e`  #and add the following line to the end...
        
        @reboot cd /home/pi && ./autostart.sh
        
4. `nano ~/mycode.scd`  #and add your code inside a waitForBoot. for example...
        
        s.waitForBoot{ {SinOsc.ar([400, 404])}.play }
        
5. `sudo reboot`  #the sound should start after a few seconds
6. log in with ssh and `killall jackd sclang scsynth` to stop the sound

benchmarks
==
these are rough benchmark tests. the server should be booted and jackd running with settings: `-P75 -p1024 -n3 -s -r44100`
also set cpu scaling to performance with...
* `echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor`

testing.

start sclang or scide and type...
        
        s.boot
        {1000000.do{2.5.sqrt}}.bench  //benchmark: ~0.65 for rpi3 headless, ~0.7 for rpi3 scide
        a= {Mix(50.collect{RLPF.ar(SinOsc.ar)});DC.ar(0)}.play
        s.avgCPU  //run a few times. should show ~12% for rpi3
        a.free

note: with the default cpu scaling ondemand these benchmarks perform much worse (double % cpu for the scsynth test for example). but ondemand also saves battery life so depending on your application this might be the preferred mode.
to set performance permanently see under gotcha [here](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/9034/how-to-change-the-default-governor#9048)

notes
==
additional information. this applies to both the scide and lite versions above.
* an easy way to burn the zip file (no need to unpack) to a sd card is to use [etcher](http://etcher.io).
* the internal soundcard volume is by default set low. type `alsamixer` in terminal and adjust the pcm volume to 85 with the arrow keys, esc key exits.
* if the `make -j 4` build step stops or returns an error the compiler might just have run out of memory. try to reboot and run the command again without `-j 4` or decrease the gpu memory in raspi-config under advanced (set it to 16).
* if you get `WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!` when trying to ssh in, type `ssh-keygen -R raspberrypi` to reset.
* for lower latency, set a lower blocksize for jackd. try for example `-p512` or `-p128`. tune downwards until you get dropouts and xruns (also watch cpu%).
* usb soundcards i’ve tried include the cheap blue 3D sound (C-Media Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter (Planet UP-100, Genius G-Talk)) and the aureon dual usb (TerraTec Electronic GmbH Aureon Dual USB). there are also some [audio codec modules](http://www.fredrikolofsson.com/f0blog/?q=node/656) that work.
* to avoid sd card corruption one should always shut down the system properly and not just pull out the 5v power. when running headless you can either ssh in and type `sudo halt -p`, use a gpio pin with a button + python script, or set up an osc command from within sc that turns off the rpi. see [here](https://github.com/blacksound/VTM/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Instructions#shutdown-for-raspberry-pi)
